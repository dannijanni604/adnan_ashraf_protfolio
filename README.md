# adnan_ashraf_portfolio

I have developed a Flutter-based personal website to showcase my development skills and projects. Built with modern UI/UX principles, this project reflects my expertise in Flutter's cross-platform capabilities, offering a responsive experience on both mobile and web platforms. The portfolio highlights key projects, technical skills, and professional accomplishments, with smooth navigation and dynamic content management. It serves as a living resume, demonstrating my proficiency in state management, API integration, and front-end design, while providing an intuitive interface for potential employers and collaborators to explore my work.
